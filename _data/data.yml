      company: Singapore Polytechnic
      details: |
        Learning express program is a program which is required to be taken by every freshman student in Singapore Polytechnic(SP). 
        The program itself is like a social program and the participants of this program are sent to various city across Asia then they are placed on some kind of village and then they need to enhance the village's potential. 
        And that was the time when one of the team from Singapore polytechnic came to Indonesia and was doing their program. 
        they needed some assistance to communicate with locals since Singaporean does little know how to speak in Malay or even Indonesian language, so we from UPN "Veteran" Yogyakarta was called by SP to help their students doing 
        their work and then from UPN opened some recruitment for this job and i applied then got accepted on the job. This is some kind of volunteer work also, because we were helping SP students doing their work, 
        not only as a guide i was there to help them brainstorming too, looking for some solution or some enhancements that can be applied for the village and locals there. 
        And this work only took 2 weeks including leisure activity.
